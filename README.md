# Economic-Disadvantange-vs-SAT
This is a look into the relation between a school's percentage of disadvantaged students and it's average SAT scores.
The dataset for this project is a .csv from the Massachussetts Department of Education https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/.
It is basic demographic, faculty, funding, and testing data from MA public and charter schools in 2017.
I found the data via kaggle.com.
I've uploaded an R markdown file with a description of my methods and my code.
